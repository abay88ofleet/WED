## Document Upload Functionality

The document upload feature is fully operational with:

1. **File Upload to Storage**
   - Files are uploaded to `documents` bucket
   - Path format: `{user_id}/{file_hash}-{filename}`
   - Automatic duplicate detection via file hash

2. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Auto-tags generation from file content
   - OCR text extraction for PDFs and Word docs
   - File metadata (size, type, dimensions)

3. **Database Insert**
   - Document records created in `documents` table
   - User ownership via `uploaded_by` field
   - Category assignment support
   - Tag array support

4. **Security**
   - All uploads validated for file type and size
   - Content scanned for malicious patterns
   - Audit logging for all uploads
   - RLS policies enforce data isolation

## Next Steps

The application is ready for use. Users can now:
- Upload documents through the UI
- Scan physical documents
- Organize with categories
- Tag and search documents
- View document history
- Share documents securely

All database migrations have been applied and the upload functionality is working correctly.
